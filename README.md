Mini Metro analyser and solver tool
## Goals 
This analyser and solver tool is meant to find the best lines in the game Mini Metro.
There are three independant components in the project : 
 - The game logic, responsible for emulating the game 
 - The solver, responsible for running algorithm to find the best lines 
 - The analyser, responsible for retrieving informations from the game using OpenCV (subject to change)
## Work in progess
As this is a work in progress, things are moving and are subject to change.
### Language choice
 Sometimes, I wonder why we decided to use Python...
 Sure we should have used fortran 66, written on punchcards, compiled with 32ko of oil-bath memory and paper printer output.  
 In all fairness, F66 > Python.
