# optimetro
Mini Metro analyser and solver tool
## Goals 
This analyser and solver tool is meant to find the best lines in the game Mini Metro.
There are three independant components in the project : 
 - The game logic, responsible for emulating the game 
 - The solver, responsible for running optimization algorithm to find the best lines
 - The analyser, responsible for retrieving informations from the original game using OpenCV (subject to change)
## Work in progess
As this is a work in progress, things are moving and are subject to change. Keep in mind this is a side project for both devs.
### Language choice
 Sometimes, I wonder why we decided to use Python...
 Sure we should have used fortran 66, written on punchcards, compiled with 32ko of oil-bath memory and paper printer output.  
 In all fairness, F66 > Python. Sometimes I wonder why C was even invented it's not like you can't do object oriented prog in Fortran. Plus who needs a GUI ?
